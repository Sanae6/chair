# Pixel Pals

A web bassed collaborative pixel art application built for our cs476 final project

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
pnpx ts-node start.ts
```
